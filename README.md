# Stock Forecasting Algorithms comparision

The Stock market has always been a field of curiosity and also a field of tremendous risk. The market is a dynamic place to be but if you play with it right then there’s no such thing as a share market, over the years many people have invested a huge amount of money and lost it whereas few have invested small chunks but pulled out a huge chunk of money. Many big players have been using various methods to trade in the market but not all methods are a success. As technology is moving forward and we’re into the data-driven world why not use the recent advancements in technology to predict the movement of the stock market, while searching for an efficient method we came across Machine learning and deep learning which have been there for decades but not that advance to predict something unpredictable. Using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms we can easily achieve trade with maximum probability, methods such as RNN, LSTM, ANN, etc. Here we are using the day-wise closing price of two different stock markets, of a company based on the historical prices available. Here we are using the day-wise closing price of two different stock markets, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We’ll be predicting the price moment based on the opening, closing, high, and low of the stock price, and by collecting the data from previous years we’ll be able to achieve promising results.
